# TODOs

* Need to ensure that bapi results only get processed for new announcements by checking release date versus current date.
* Need to check that data persists and can be viewed in tables when app runs
* Need to check that thymeleaf view and other endpoints displays
* Need to start thinking about mock service for new announcements
* ... and new trades with the result of position (successful or not, being logged)
* Need to start testing these mock services and ensuring DJL model is trained
* Finally, need to factor this model into future decision making
